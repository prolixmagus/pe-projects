		         	<h2>Who is Spencer?</h2>

		            <p>During the 1990s, I was an 18 year old psychobilly kid rocking out to The Cramps and Demented Are Go. An amateur cartoonist and zine-fiend, of course I fell in with the trike and motorcycle mod scene. Too bad it didn’t bring in a lot of money. At 24, my mother (love you) kicked me out of the basement; guess it was time to ‘get a real job.’ Turns out art and engineering make a beautiful marriage in architecture. Once I drew my first blueprint (of a skate park, no less), I was hooked.
		            </p>

		            <p>As the years went by, I felt the urge to break through the blue and white grid. Tired of designing for others, I found himself back in the garage one night contemplating the flat tire on my wife’s blue Prius (I swear it ain't mine), 3 bedroom home in the ‘burbs, 2.5 kids sleeping peacefully upstairs. I felt the rumblings of kustom kulture, the need to break and remake and tear shit up.
		            </p>

		            <p>Then, I saw it - a dusty, banged up stratocaster tucked in a corner near some half-opened paint cans. I’d almost forgotten it was there. What had it been, almost 30 years?
		            </p>

		             <p>I knew what I had to do. I threw it on my workbench, knocked open a bottle of Steel Reserve, and tore that guitar’s guts out.
		            </p>
		            
		            <p>That’s how Spencer’s Guitars was born.

		            <h2>Guitar Building Process</h2>

		            <p>This ain't me, it's the luthier Adam Koekkek! My process is simliar (maybe with a bit more grease and beer). In case you're wondering why it takes 3-5 weeks to make a guitar, now you know. Respect the process.
