# Personal Website

Welcome to my personal website! So far, it has gone through four structural iterations.

1. Single page HTML with inline-styles sans flex or grid
2. Several HTML pages with linked CSS stylesheets using flex
3. Template-based pages with loaded via PHP routering using flex and grid
4. Template-based modules hydrated via JSON and inserted with PHP, styled using a 12-column grid + subgrid.
