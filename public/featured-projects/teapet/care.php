	<p>Tea pets are marvelous creatures born from the Earth. Since Song Dynasty in 960, these pets have been traditionally molded from Zisha clay (kaolin, quartz, and mica) near city of Yixing. As their popularity spread across the world, enthusiasts began creating ceramic, stone, porcelain, and even wooden pets.</p>

	<p>When preparing tea, there are traditionally three pours of hot water. The first is for warming the cup, the second is for rinsing the tea, and the final pour is for brewing the tea.</p>

	<p>Only the final pour is meant for drinking. The first and second pour are used to shower and feed your tea pet!</p>

	<p>All tea pets are porous. Zisha clay is particularly special, for it absorbs the tanins of the tea, bringng out the true shades of the clay. As you water your tea pet more, it will turn a rich, dark purple and smell like your favorite tea.</p>

	<p>Tea pets love being washed, but <span class="warning">do not</span> use soap! As the pets are porous, they will absorb the soap - and the tea pet's color transformation will be diminished.</p>
