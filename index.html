					<p>My name is Jeremy Fishman and I'm thrilled you decided to check out my work. It reminds me of why I am.</p> 

					<p>First, some housekeeping:</p>
					
					<ol>
						<li>You can email me at <a href='mailto:jeremypfishman@gmail.com'></a> with any questions or if you want to knock ideas around. I usually respond within 24 hours.</li>
						<li>Of course I <a href='prolixmagus.substack.com'></a>blog! Why even ask?</li>
					</ol>

					<p>Now that that's done, let's get this presentation started with an <em>aperetif</em>!</p>

					<p class='lfps'>I am a web developer and K-12 ESL educator who helps students (or users) of all ages navigate foreign-seeming systems. My steadfast patience, cross-cultural knowledge, and playful mindset help make complex topics digestible.</p>

					
					<p>But wait! That can't be it! After all, you and I <a href='https://poets.org/poem/song-myself-51'>contain multitudes</a>.</p>
