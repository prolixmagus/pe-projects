	<h2 class='attention-voice'>Typeface - Noto Sans</h2>
	<p>As a language teacher and learner, I value typefaces that are easy to read and do not distract from the content. Noto Sans is designed to be read on the web and to be accessible to a global community, as demonstrated by an enormous family of over 1,000 fonts that encompasses over 150 writing systems. It's round counters give an amicable impression which is balanced out by uniform stroke width and traditional punctuation. I want my website to be welcoming, but ready to work.</p>
