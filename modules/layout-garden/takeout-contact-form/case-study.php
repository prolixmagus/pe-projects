	<h2 class='small-heading'>Takeout form</h2>
	<p class='calm-voice'>This form seemed appealing because of its various fields and spanned grid frames that looked like layered bricks. Suffice to say, it was more difficult than I thought to preserve the aesthetic. I used <code>margin: calc(-0.5* 2px);</code> to keep the borders from overlapping. One of the key takeaway was reflecitng on the purpose of online forms. Was this from accessible? Is it better to have vertical forms (as it appears on a smaller screen) or forms side by side? What information do you really need from your clients to begin a relationship?</p>
