<h2 class='small-heading'>Headline Layout 1</h2>
<p class='calm-voice'>This is a common layout found on content aggregation or news websites. I creatd an "article list" and "picture list" containers, flexing them side by side. Each container was a two-column grid, but I spanned the heading list element across two columns to draw attention to a featured article. The list of headlines is actually styled / written as a separate "article grid card" module that I looped over and included in the parent "article grid" module.</p>
