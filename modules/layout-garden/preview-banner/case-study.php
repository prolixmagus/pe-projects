	<h2 class='small-heading'>Hulu “Most Watched” Preview Banner</h2>
	<p class='calm-voice'>I saw this layout while browsing Hulu and thought to myself, "I can do this!" I'm sure there are ways to optimize it for smaller screen sizes. I utilized the techniques from the <a href='index.php?page=layout&slug=cta-overlap'>cta-overlap</a> to overlay the title over the number. I used a color picker to find the right colors to make a linear-gradient, then found the font used for the actual movie title. Oh hai, layout garden!</p>
