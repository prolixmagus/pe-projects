	<h2 class='small-heading'>Fly Fishing Grid</h2>
	<p class='calm-voice'>I chose this layout because because it is a common method for displaying related items. I loved the contrast between the weight of the category name and item name. The oval button, thin divider ines, and copious whitespace highlight the colorful items. Not to mention all of the practice I had adjusting grid for various screen sizes with media break points!</p>
