# Tea Pet Store

Are you lonely? Do you like tea? Well, get yourself a tea pet and solve all of your problems!

## Description

I created a website for a fictional storefront that sells [tea pets](https://www.teamuse.com/article_200814.html). The website utilizes PHP partials, url routing, stylized forms, and CRUD functionality.

Before you ask - this is a student project, just for practice! you can find Tea Pets all over the web at various marketplaces.

## Dependencies

A local server environment to run PHP scripts [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/mac/).
