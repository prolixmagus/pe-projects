						<p>Things are going pretty well so far. Trying to do things by the program, so going back to Sublime Text after a stint with VSCode. This is a nice review of HTML - feels good to practice.</p>

						<p>I'm trying not to tackle too many things at once, but I feel there is <i>so</i> much to catch up on. I want to try and make one Affinity doodle a day, or learn one new little trick in Affinity. I also want to keep brainstorming ideas, since I know there's the spectre of the <b>big</b> project later in the course. I'm glad that I'm nurturing it now.</p>

						<p>The hardest thing right now is to get through my part-time tutoring job, since I'd rather be at home tinkering around! I think P.E. should send out stickers. Stickers are always good.</p>
