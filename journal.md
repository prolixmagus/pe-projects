## Affinity 2 Tutorials
### 11/8/23

Here is the order where I watched the [Affinity Designer 2 tutorial videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1t9c--IJQQ99NlXuW6bVvLK-h199uk7e)

1. U.I.
2. Layers Panel
3. Vector Brush Tool
4. Pixel Tool
5. Pen Tool
6. Layer Effects
7. Multiple Strokes and Fills (??? -> too advanced for now, so...)
8. Transform, scale, rotate, shear

I also learned how to add meta tags and create shareable images. A little confused on where to put the final product, but we will see!
