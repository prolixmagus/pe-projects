## Semantic Mark-Up
### 11/19/23

To be discovered! Isn't that the ultimate goal, to show off our work? So why wouldn't we want search engines to find us? Cue semantic markup, wonderful CSS additions that reveal the data structure behind that wonderful styling of yours.

Today I styled a website using flex, semantic markup, and lots of gradients. It was a good time, and I saw the benefit of styling the parent for layout vs. the child. Let's you keep track of position and how the styles affect everything the parent contains.

## More CSS Reset
### 11/18/23

Today I experimented with typography and margins. Line height, letter spacing, box-sizing specifically. I basically styled an  blog entry I wrote when I lived into Taiwan (almost 7 years ago now!), primarily focusing on readability.

I'm also listening to Andre 3000's experimental jazz flute album, New Blue Sun. There are some remixes just waiting to happen...

## CSS Reset
### 11/17/23

Today I am watching and responding to Lesson 40, "More CSS Resets," in Perpetual Education's Design for the Web Course.

- The ["Kitchen Sink" CodePen](https://codepen.io/chriscoyier/pen/JpLzjd) is very useful for having examples of HTML elements in the wild.

- I would further stress that an id can only be used once per page for THAT element, and that it will be important later why this is so. Or that classes are primarily used for styling.

-I would love to know the best practices for NAMING classes, or if classes supercede the element.

-Would it be better to teach what to do first, then what not to do? I think both are necessary, just wondering the order. I like to see non-examples alongside examples.

-I like showing the little space between the inline-block elements.

-Maybe add a border to the Drake example?


## Mini-Project
### 11/11/23

Today I threw together a few webpages to make a mini-site about classic horror games from the 1990s - 2000s. The process was fun, but I definitely spent a lot of time nitpicking over colors and fonts. I want to focus on choosing the correct size for images that matches with the content / layout.


## Meta Tags and Playing with Gradients
### 11/9/23

Takeaways:
- In order to link to your image for sharing, you need to add the absolute path.
- Why does "X" have so many unique `property` tags? Can't they just use open graph?
- I need to be more comfortable making mistakes. Nothing is TOO permanent...

Gradients:
- Fun to play around with
- Easy to make something pleasing to the eye
- Easy to go overboard
- Less is more? Maybe?


## Affinity 2 Tutorials
### 11/8/23

Here is the order where I watched the [Affinity Designer 2 tutorial videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1t9c--IJQQ99NlXuW6bVvLK-h199uk7e)

1. U.I.
2. Layers Panel
3. Vector Brush Tool
4. Pixel Tool
5. Pen Tool
6. Layer Effects
7. Multiple Strokes and Fills (??? -> too advanced for now, so...)
8. Transform, scale, rotate, shear

I also learned how to add meta tags and create shareable images. A little confused on where to put the final product, but we will see!
