## Research and Destroy Reflection

I started my search by googling "intermediate website layout" and the internet delievered unto me a listicle from a website call [htmlburger](https://htmlburger.com/blog/modern-website-design-examples/). These websites were mostly brand agencies that were using so many responsive / interactive elements that I thought, this couldn't possbly be for intermediates. I found an [orthodontist's website](https://www.myorthos.com/) that I felt was accessible, although definitely designed in a manner beyond what I could do now. I felt like it had grid or flexbox (which, after inspecting it, definitely utilized), but I wanted to practice creating a website for a business. I also felt that I could match the minimal colors and font styles, as well as the GENERAL layout. 

So far, I definitely know what I don't know:

- buttons and certain transition effects
- images or text that responds based on scrolling position
- SVG manipulation
- @media queries (I've heard of them, but not sure how to implement them successfully)
- Drop down menus (is this realted to <details> and <summary> elements?) in the nav bar
- the hamburger button on the nav bar
- image positioning

I marked up the 'boxes' and section on CleanShot. I feel as if I were designing my own webpage (and not mimicking one), drawing it out may be better. I feel you really have to be deliberate and know what boxes go where. It's easier to draw on outline on an already completed site.   

Reflections:

I definitely did not get through as much as I wanted. I got hung up on the nav bar and perfecting it before moving on. Once I got into the swing of things, it went much faster. Having a plan REALLY helped, because you can get lost in one section and then, once you emerge from the depths, know exactly where you need to go. A lot of unexpected things arose, such as knowing which element should be responsible for general margins/padding, and which for styling. 

## Uncle Bill's Challenge
### 11/20/23
- While Ivy went heading by heading, I focused on section by section. I also thought of 'how are these links going to get aligned ...' then I remembered, they are inline!

- Marking up the website! So obvious, but I didn't do it at first 0_o

- Checklist of properties and elements. I'm sure it becomes automatic over time (the most commonly used properties / elements)

- The `tab` tag shortcut in CodePen is clutch

- Padding should be on parent section, not necessarily on image sin the parent.

- The side-by-side columns of HTML/CSS/JS in the Text-Editor, all things aligning, was great to see visually.

Reconfiguring the website didn't take that long structurally, perhaps 15 minutes. The biggest issue was nitpicking the gradients and the iframe, as well as fitting the photos into the gallery section. Those little problems took me an additional 25 minutes. I find myself falling into little whirlpools (which is where the learning happens, I suppose!) As long as those little detours are goal driven. I had to go back to a previous lesson to double-check how to resize an iframe properly.

I learned how to make stacked gradients and to adjust their opacity to make it look like they come from different directions. I learned that setting overflow: hidden and display: inline-block can keep pictures from jutting out of a section. 

## Semantic Mark-Up
### 11/19/23

To be discovered! Isn't that the ultimate goal, to show off our work? So why wouldn't we want search engines to find us? Cue semantic markup, wonderful CSS additions that reveal the data structure behind that wonderful styling of yours.

Today I styled a website using flex, semantic markup, and lots of gradients. It was a good time, and I saw the benefit of styling the parent for layout vs. the child. Let's you keep track of position and how the styles affect everything the parent contains.

## More CSS Reset
### 11/18/23

Today I experimented with typography and margins. Line height, letter spacing, box-sizing specifically. I basically styled an  blog entry I wrote when I lived into Taiwan (almost 7 years ago now!), primarily focusing on readability.

I'm also listening to Andre 3000's experimental jazz flute album, New Blue Sun. There are some remixes just waiting to happen...

## CSS Reset
### 11/17/23

Today I am watching and responding to Lesson 40, "More CSS Resets," in Perpetual Education's Design for the Web Course.

- The ["Kitchen Sink" CodePen](https://codepen.io/chriscoyier/pen/JpLzjd) is very useful for having examples of HTML elements in the wild.

- I would further stress that an id can only be used once per page for THAT element, and that it will be important later why this is so. Or that classes are primarily used for styling.

-I would love to know the best practices for NAMING classes, or if classes supercede the element.

-Would it be better to teach what to do first, then what not to do? I think both are necessary, just wondering the order. I like to see non-examples alongside examples.

-I like showing the little space between the inline-block elements.

-Maybe add a border to the Drake example?


## Mini-Project
### 11/11/23

Today I threw together a few webpages to make a mini-site about classic horror games from the 1990s - 2000s. The process was fun, but I definitely spent a lot of time nitpicking over colors and fonts. I want to focus on choosing the correct size for images that matches with the content / layout.


## Meta Tags and Playing with Gradients
### 11/9/23

Takeaways:
- In order to link to your image for sharing, you need to add the absolute path.
- Why does "X" have so many unique `property` tags? Can't they just use open graph?
- I need to be more comfortable making mistakes. Nothing is TOO permanent...

Gradients:
- Fun to play around with
- Easy to make something pleasing to the eye
- Easy to go overboard
- Less is more? Maybe?


## Affinity 2 Tutorials
### 11/8/23

Here is the order where I watched the [Affinity Designer 2 tutorial videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1t9c--IJQQ99NlXuW6bVvLK-h199uk7e)

1. U.I.
2. Layers Panel
3. Vector Brush Tool
4. Pixel Tool
5. Pen Tool
6. Layer Effects
7. Multiple Strokes and Fills (??? -> too advanced for now, so...)
8. Transform, scale, rotate, shear

I also learned how to add meta tags and create shareable images. A little confused on where to put the final product, but we will see!
